				<strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hi, I'm a Chinese boy who called York. What I can show you is that I am very skilled in technology. I have many friends in many countries. You know, Siri doesn't like to talk about herself, I don't like it either. Well, since it is my personal website, I will inevitably discuss myself. If you have any questions, please don’t be surprised.
				<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I like sincere people. We can share our hearts and minds with each other. Although I am always ashamed to be in contact with people in my life, I am better at talk with people online. In reality and online I am quite like two people. But whether online or in reality, I never like friends who cheat and take advantage of others. Interestingly, I found that the farther away a friend is from you, the more worthy you are to be friends with him. Because our interests will not conflict, naturally there is nothing to hide. These are also why I am an Chinese but writing in English on my website. That doesn't mean I don't like friends around me, but sometimes I do get tired of keeping an eye on some of them... Besides, I don't like to talk cruelly about topics that could have been said to be pleasant. (Somebody always thinks that's what's called objectivity and there will be an example to help you understand this sentence.) Ah, it's a heavy topic, but I really don't want you to be that kind of people. I also hope to be friends with good people. 
				<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After we become friends, we can talk about technology happily. You must know something about me by browsing the index page. But I don't think those can express themselves clearly. On index page, I can only summarize things about me very simply and roughly. Neither introducing myself nor technology should be like this. I have too many things I want to share with you, and I have too much to learn from you, too. I will share my works and my interesting things on this website so that you can know me better. Why don't I share my technology on this website? Because I only share it with my true friends. <b>(So be my friend!)</b> Ow, sorry, we have not discussed technology until now. Let's get started now. Technology is really a way to create a better world, even more than the empty things taught in school. This makes me sound like a realist. At the same time, I also remenbered a sentence. The optimist looked up and fell into the pothole. The pessimists looked down and broke their heads. Realists look forward and forget themselves. So you seem to be inevitably hurt if you go on. So I chose to be a technology-protected person (Even I feel that I am talking nonsense, too.) . Forget it, it seems that I am not very likely to introduce topics. But I didn't really think about how to talk about technology to you. If I talk too little, you will hear it unclear. If I talk too much, you may lose interest. How difficult is it! Oh, no. I'm <b>BSing</b> all the time! If you still have patience, I will really talk about technology in the next paragraph. REALLY. 
					<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As soon as I talk about technology, I will introduce it with my personal experience. I was crazy about Minecraft when I was young. (Not losing enthusiasm yet) Oh, my Minecraft, it is like heaven. I can no longer desperately want to have my own server. At the same time, I hope to make my server fantasticly. I can't supply a high server annual rental fee due to poor economic conditions. That's why I researched the principles of the server. I used my home laptop to run the server. So countless questions flooded me. Why is my server always crashing? How are those magical effects achieved? How can I make my server more interesting? Correspondingly, I learned knowledge about intranet penetration, firewall, port mapping, programming, etc. Its short-term advantage is that I can ensure that my server is not always crashing, I understand which mods are running smoothly and so on. Unfortunately, my server will still crash and crash. I didn't realize that the CPU of the laptop was not suitable for long-term operation or long-term overclocking until I found out that the CPU in the laptop was aging. But I still can't afford to buy a server CPU. The journey to explore the server has temporarily stopped. But I still believe that one day I will buy the <b>d**n</b>(sorry) expensive XEON or EPYC(At that time, EPYC has not been developed yet.). In fact, I was a little indifferent to Minecraft at that time... It happens that I started to like to show off to friends, So I started to learn hacking knowledge. In fact, it was not used until the end of third grade in junior high school. However, I was fortunate enough to participate in the school tour during the summer vacation in the sixth grade of primary school. I met a Korean bro who and whose friends like Minecraft very much. In junior high school, my schoolwork was not going well, so I don't have much time to spend on those things. But I am preparing for something. In fact, I am not so obedient. I used to break into the school's lab where I could make a propellant called KN-SU (Sorry, I don't know how to spell this <b>weird</b> word, its called 硝糖 in Chinese.) I filled that kind of propellant with my small rocket (or missile?), which made my stuff fly dozens of meters away. By the way, once I did want to make a small missile, but I seem to be mistaken so much that my little missile became a fireworks(<b>XD</b>). Ok, maybe China has a magical power to turn my missile into a fireworks. Come on, which boy does't like missiles? Another thing that impressed me in junior high school was that I met a so-called friend on the Internet, and I saw him at a glance as someone who always used others. So I gently led him step by step into my trap, and eventually he spent hundreds of RMB in vain and was laughed aside by netizens. Aw. I suddenly found out that I was running off the subject <b>AGAIN</b>. Even more frightening is that I don’t know how to continue. <b>(QAQ)</b> Let us talk about what I did recently. I have done a lot of things this summer. I developed a system for the Internet of Things and tested it using a microcontroller. Not too bad, but I am not satisfied. I also learned a lot about modeling, and softwares like C4D, Maya I has a bit of a sense. I hope to use this skill to achieve the game I imaged in the future. But I can't figure out in AutoCAD. Oh, no, York. I originally wanted to print a set of missiles by 3D printer (There is a 3D printer in my great daddy's workplace). You know what, I have already designed my missiles and I have already named those 48 missiles! These days I'm busy coding my website. The Adobe Dreamweaver give me 7 days, but it's not enough so I cracked it... I know it's wrong but I really want to learn something (The crack for learning purposes is <b>in the law</b>). I also planned to produce some videos and sent them online, But I am <b>once again</b> blocked by my schoolwork. So, I put off this plan. I even don't know when I can finish it. Anyway, if you have any good ideas, we can cooperate. I like to cooperate. 
					<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you like me, please support me. <b>Thankssss~</b> (eg.Rather than imagining that "Only subscription / fabulous will support me, so you'd better do that! Or we goodbye!" doesn't that sound like a threat? Too bad! <b>:(</b> ) Oops, maybe you will feel very uncomfortable in your heart after reading this article, but please forgive my poor English level and expressive ability. Maybe it's because I don't express it accurately enough. Maybe? Any criticisms or comments are also welcome in the Message Board. <b>Come and point me out!</b> You can slightly point out my mistakes in spelling and grammar,too. (<b>Gently, Daddy!</b> This is very shameful! <b>:(</b> )
					<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sharing is human nature, isn'it? Look at the picture on the right of the page. These are <b>just</b> my knowledge map about technology. The perfect world is yet to come. So let's work together to create a better tomorrow!<strong>
